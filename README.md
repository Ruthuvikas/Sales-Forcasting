### **Sales Forecasting Report for Retail Store Inventory Management**

#### **Objective**
The goal of this project is to address the challenges faced by a retail store chain in managing inventory by forecasting sales for the next 12 months. Accurate sales forecasting will help optimize inventory levels, reduce overstocking and understocking, and ensure the store meets customer demand effectively.

### **Approach**

#### **Data Overview**
The dataset used for forecasting contained the following columns:
1. **Store**: Unique identifier for each outlet.
2. **Date (`ds`)**: Weekly timestamps for historical sales data.
3. **Weekly Sales (`y`)**: Total sales revenue for each store in a given week.
4. **Fuel Price**: Average fuel price near the store for each week.
5. **CPI (Consumer Price Index)**: Reflects the cost of goods over time.
6. **Unemployment**: Weekly unemployment rate.
7. **Holiday Flag**: Binary indicator of holiday weeks (1 = holiday, 0 = non-holiday).

#### **Methodology**
We used **Facebook Prophet**, a robust time-series forecasting model, which decomposes the sales data into three main components:
1. **Trend**: Captures the long-term increase or decrease in sales.
2. **Seasonality**: Models recurring patterns such as weekly, monthly, or yearly fluctuations.
3. **External Regressors**: Factors such as fuel prices, CPI, unemployment, and holidays that influence sales.

Steps followed:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identified trends, seasonal patterns, and the impact of holidays.
   - Correlation analysis revealed that fuel prices and unemployment were inversely related to sales, while CPI showed a moderate positive correlation.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Added regressors (`fuel_price`, `cpi`, `unemployment`, `holiday`) to improve the model’s accuracy.
   - Created lagging indicators and moving averages for additional insights (e.g., sales of the last 4 weeks).
3. **Prophet Forecasting**:
   - Trained the Prophet model on historical sales data (2010–2023).
   - Forecasted sales for the next 12 months with confidence intervals.
   - Assumed stable future trends for regressors where actual future data was unavailable.

### **Findings and Insights**

#### **Sales Forecast**
- **Projected Sales**: The forecasted sales for the next year show consistent seasonality with peaks during holiday periods.
- **Trend Analysis**: A slight decline in the overall trend of sales was observed, likely due to external economic factors such as fuel prices and unemployment.
- **Seasonality**:
  - **Strong Peaks**: November–December showed a significant increase in sales, attributed to holiday shopping and promotions (e.g., Black Friday).
  - **Lows**: Post-holiday slump in January and mid-year months.

#### **Impact of External Factors**
1. **Fuel Price**:
   - A higher fuel price negatively impacted sales as customers may limit non-essential trips or purchases.
2. **CPI**:
   - A rising CPI was moderately associated with higher sales, likely due to inflationary pricing on goods.
3. **Unemployment**:
   - Sales were inversely related to unemployment, highlighting the sensitivity of demand to economic conditions.
4. **Holidays**:
   - Sales spikes during holiday weeks confirmed their critical role in driving revenue. Non-holiday weeks showed stable, lower sales.

### **Model Performance**
1. **Training and Validation**:
   - The model was validated using a train-test split (80% training, 20% test).
   - Metrics:
     - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: 5.2%
     - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: $12,000 (weekly sales).
   - The model captured seasonality and trend effectively, with small deviations in extreme outliers.

2. **Forecast Accuracy**:
   - The model performed well in predicting regular sales patterns but showed slight underestimation during extreme holiday peaks.

### **Recommendations**
1. **Inventory Optimization**:
   - Allocate higher inventory levels to outlets during peak seasons (November–December).
   - Reduce inventory levels during January to avoid overstocking.
2. **Dynamic Pricing**:
   - Use the insights on fuel prices and unemployment to adjust pricing strategies.
   - Consider discounts or promotions in areas with higher unemployment to boost demand.
3. **Holiday Planning**:
   - Prioritize marketing and stock replenishment efforts around major holidays.
   - Focus on regions or outlets with historically higher holiday sales.
4. **Forecast Updates**:
   - Regularly update the forecast with the latest sales and external factor data for more accurate predictions.
   - Monitor new trends or anomalies (e.g., unexpected events or policy changes).

### **Conclusion**
The 12-month sales forecast using the Prophet model provides a reliable foundation for inventory management and planning. By incorporating external factors and seasonal trends, the model helps the retail chain align supply with demand, minimize costs, and improve customer satisfaction.
